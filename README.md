# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detectio
This project focuses on early detection of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and speech. Early diagnosis can help in better management of the disease.

1.Project Overview
Uses ML models to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease from patient data.
Analyzes voice-based biomarkers and other medical parameters.
Implements data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
2. Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
3. Dataset
The dataset contains voice recordings and medical features used for classification.
Features include MDVP jitter, shimmer, fundamental frequency, HNR, and spread measures.
4. Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and extracts key features.
Feature Engineering: Selects the most important attributes for better prediction.
Model Training: Implements classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure model performance.
